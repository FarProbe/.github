## What is FarProbe?

FarProbe is a web application that connects to EZ-USB FX2LP based logic analyzers (Saleae, USBee, and their clones) from the browser and streams data to the cloud. Open a Chromium-based browser, plug in the analyzer, and you are ready to start debugging your hardware. Share a link, and you are ready to start collaborating.

## Why did we start it?

Often enough I worked on my hardware projects while on the go. Traveling to clients, staying in hotel rooms, I missed a simple tool that allowed me to see what is going on, diagnose it and iterate on the go. I have also seen that problem in the other direction - most recently, I was hybrid-working on electric aircraft avionics, sometimes with the aircraft on the side of the US. Frequently I had to call some on-site engineers to connect some instruments and screen-share, file-share, send screenshots, etc., to give me a glimpse of the elusive GPS-related bug I was hunting down.

## What can FarProbe do today?

Bare minimum - we like to build in public and want to see where the community needs lead us!

You can use a logic analyzer locally, send a link to someone else to capture data for you remotely, you can run long-term acquisitions on our cloud - and export to PulseView for further analysis. You can also invite your colleagues to look at your issue without installing anything new.

## What do we want to do in the future?

Plenty. Support more hardware (Oscilloscopes? Any favorite devices you really wished for had better software support?); Implement protocol decoders (also in the cloud); Implement device emulators and test fixtures. Overall - be the software company that gets hardware - and implements the companion software well.

## What do we keep here? 

Contributions to open-source components of our platform. Staging areas for upstream PRs. In the future - community-contributed components as well.
